MIOPY: Python tool to study miRNA-mRNA relationships. 
====================================================================================================



MIOPY is a Python3 tool that allows studying the miRNA/mRNA interaction in several different ways. MIOPY includes the state-of-the-art method to predict miRNA target through expression data. MIOPY includes 40 pre-process prediction tools 
to improve the results. Finally, MIOPY allows to use the of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to apply a feature selection in order to identify prognostic biomarker signatures.
 
The four main types of analyses available in MIOPY are:

* Correlation and regularized regression analysis
* microRNA target prediction
* Identification of prognostic biomarkers and survival analyses
* Identification of predictive biomarkers and classification

MIOPY was developed to handle the analysis in `MIO <http://mio.icbi.at>`_. Please check the MIO `repository <http://github.com/icbi-lab/mio>`_
 to run MIO locally. MIOPY includes all the functions to run the analyses that MIO from python.
